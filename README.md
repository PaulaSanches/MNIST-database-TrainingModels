# MNIST-database-TrainingModels
The MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) is a set of 70,000 small image digits handwritten. It is used for training models to recognize handwritten, face recognition and medical diagnosis. 

# Conclusion
Random Forests work well for a large range of data than the decision trees overcoming the problem of overfitting or combining the different results of decision trees. Also, they are flexible and possess a high level of accuracy. Moreover, Random Forests have good accuracy even some data is missing. However, they are much harder time consuming than decision trees, making them slow and requiring more computational resources. Beyond this, Random Forest do not work very well with data complexity.

Regards to Support Vector Machine (SVM) works well with high-dimensional space, and it is also memory effective. The most significant disadvantage is that the data needs to be standardized in preparation stage, and overfitting occasionally happens.Â
